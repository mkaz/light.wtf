## Build

You can build each by running `make expcalc-build` or watch for development
using `make expcalc-watch`.  The `public` directory is simply static files so I
have a local virtual host pointed there, you can use that or run a local server
out of that directory.


See [Issues](https://github.com/mkaz/light.wtf/issues) for known issues, or
report any problems or suggestions there.
